# Numerical-Analysis-Projects
Numerical analysis of a 1D steady-state heat equation with a discontinuity in thermal conductivity. Implemented the Finite Difference Method (FDM) in MATLAB to solve and compare numerical vs. analytical solutions. Explored temperature distribution in composite materials with varying thermal conductivity ratios and discontinuity locations.
